# 🩸 BloodBuddy
BloodBuddy is a web application that aims to bridge the gap between blood donors and people in need of blood transfusions. The app allows donors to register and provide their blood group, location, and availability to donate blood. People who need blood can create requests, search for donors based on their location and blood group, and contact them for donations. The app also includes user authentication and registration, ensuring that the personal information of both donors and recipients is kept secure.

This project was developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework. 💻 Django is a high-level web framework for Python that allows developers to quickly build web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and uses an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system to map data from a relational database to objects that can be manipulated in Python.
